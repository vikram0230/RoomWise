# Customer Analysis System

The Customer Analysis System is an end-to-end solution for reserving rooms according to a priority queue by processing and storing data from a customer booking portal. It uses MongoDB and FastAPI to store data in a reliable and scalable database, and provides powerful analysis to help managers make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features

- MongoDB database for reliable and scalable data storage
- FastAPI for building an efficient and modern web API
- Built-in machine learning models for prioritizing customers and predicting cancellations
- 90% accuracy rate achieved using ML models, such as SVM and Random Forest.

## How it Works

The Customer Analysis System is designed to process and store data from a customer booking portal. Data is collected and stored in MongoDB using FastAPI, and can be queried as required.

The system also includes built-in machine learning models for prioritizing customers and predicting cancellations. These models include Support Vector Machines for predicting cancellations and Random Forest for prioritizing customers to achieve a high level of accuracy.

Finally, the Customer Analysis System provides managers with the ability to analyze trends in customer behavior, identify potential areas for improvement, and create data-driven mitigation plans to reduce cancellations and improve profitability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Customer Analysis System, follow these steps:

1. Install MongoDB and FastAPI on your local machine
2. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies
3. Import the data from your customer booking portal into the MongoDB database
4. Start the FastAPI server and request the API the customer data
